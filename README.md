# Registration form page
## What?
This project is no more than a simple registration form page, created to practice the creation of forms in HTML, their styling through CSS, and some light validation through JavaScript.

The only validation performed is to check if the confirm password input's value matches with the previous one. Even if it's simple, it was interesting to implement in order to learn how to set a form widget's validity through JavaScript. The API seems very powerful and I'm curious if I'll have to use it in a future project.

## Why?
This was done as part of The Odin Project's Javascript course. It's one of the projects from the Intermediate HTML and CSS Course. [(Link)](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css)

## Future features
I have plans on developing a personal project about Korean language and the Test of Proficiency in Korean, so that's why I used that theme for this project.
